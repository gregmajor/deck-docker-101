## Installation

https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community

### Windows Users

- 64-bit Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education (Update 1607, Build 14393 or later)
- Requires Hyper-V (preferred) or Docker Toolbox (Oracle Virtual Box)
- Virtualization must be enabled in the BIOS
- Nested virtualization is not guaranteed

### Mac and Linux Users

- Yeah, it'll almost certainly work with anything less than 5 years old

## Hello World!

```sh
$ docker container run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
9bb5a5d4561a: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:f5233545e43561214ca4891fd1157e1c3c563316ed8e237750d59bde73361e77
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:

@[2-27](Output)

```

@[1,2](You can present code inlined within your slide markdown too.)
@[9-17](Displayed using code-syntax highlighting just like your IDE.)
@[19-20](Again, all of this without ever leaving your slideshow.)

@[23](You can even present code found within any GitHub GIST.)
@[41-53](GIST source code is beautifully rendered on any slide.)
@[57-62](And code-presenting works seamlessly for GIST too, both online and offline.)
